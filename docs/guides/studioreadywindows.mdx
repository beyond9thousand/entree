# Studio Ready Windows

Here is my guide for a studio-ready Windows installation. It's based on my personal expertise and knowledge as a creative head, tailored to optimize a PC for creative work and studio environments. This should be considered the blueprint for a lean, efficient, and reliable system, free of unnecessary software and potential conflicts.

<Expand title="Generate your Custom Windows ISO">

- Go to the [website](https://uupdump.net/)
- Select a Windows build you want to download.
- Choose your desired language and the specific Windows editions you want to include
- Click **Create download package** to download a small ZIP file
- Extract the ZIP file and run the script inside (it will have a `.cmd` extension) to start the download and build process for your custom ISO

:::info
After the `uup_download_windows.cmd` script has completed the download and conversion process, the generated ISO file will be located in the same folder where you extracted the UUP Dump tool's ZIP archive. You will see a new ISO file with a name that corresponds to the Windows build you chose, like `26200.5751_en-us_professional_amd64.iso.`

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-rotate" /> Pausing Windows Updates

You can use the **Registry Editor** to pause Windows updates for a very long time, which is useful if you want more control over when updates are installed. Be careful when editing the registry, as incorrect changes can cause system problems.

- Open the **Registry Editor** by pressing the **Windows Key** and searching for `Regedit`
- Navigate to the following path:

```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UX\Settings
```

- Find or create a **DWORD (32-bit) Value** named `FlightSettingsMaxPauseDays`
- Double-click on it, select `Decimal`, and change the `Value data` to a high number like **`365`** to pause updates for a year
- Click **OK** to save your changes

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-network-wired" /> Shared Folder Access

:::info
Error Message: `You can't access this shared folder because your organization's security policies block unauthenticated guest access.` It involves a simple change in the **Registry Editor** to allow guest access to shared folders.
:::

- Open the **Registry Editor** by searching for `Regedit` in the Start menu
- Navigate to the following path:

```
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters
```

- Find or create a **DWORD (32-bit) Value** named `AllowInsecureGuestAuth`
- Double-click on it and set its `Value data` to **`1`**
- Click **OK** and restart your computer for the change to take effect

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-unlock-keyhole" /> Authorise Remote Access

Prevent Windows from locking you out of your account when using remote desktop tools like [VNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNC). Sometimes, the Windows security feature that protects against too many failed login attempts can get confused and see your successful remote connection as a threat. By following these steps, you will disable this feature entirely.

- Open the **Group Policy Editor** by pressing the **Windows Key + R**, typing `gpedit.msc`, and pressing **Enter**
- Navigate to `Computer Configuration` > `Windows Settings` > `Security Settings` > `Account Policies` > `Account Lockout Policy`
- Double-click on **Account lockout threshold**
- Change the number of invalid login attempts to **`0`** and click **OK**

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-ban" /> Disabling Secure Boot

[Secure Boot](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/xrhmq2/secure_boot_what_are_the_downsides/) is a security feature that prevents unauthorized software from loading during the boot process. While it's great for security, it can sometimes block you from using certain bootable USB drives, especially older or custom ones. Disabling it can help you get around this. The exact steps vary by motherboard manufacturer, but the general process is the same.

- Restart your PC and enter your BIOS/UEFI firmware settings. This is usually done by pressing a key like **F2**, **F10**, **F12**, or **Del** as soon as the computer starts.
- Once in the BIOS, find the **Secure Boot** setting. It's often located under the **Boot**, **Security**, or **Authentication** sections.
- Change the setting from `Enabled` to `Disabled`.
- Save your changes and exit the BIOS. The PC will then restart.

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-cubes" /> Package Managers

Package managers are tools that automate the installation and management of software. Instead of searching the web for an installer, you can use a single command to install a program. **Scoop** and **Winget** are two popular package managers for Windows that install license-free software

### Install Scoop

- Open **PowerShell** as an administrator.
- Run the command:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

- Then, run the command:

```
irm get.scoop.sh | iex
```

### Install Winget

- Winget is pre-installed on most modern Windows 10 and 11 systems.

:::info
On a newly installed Windows system, Winget might not work right away. This is because the `App Installer` app in the Microsoft Store needs to be updated. Open the Microsoft Store, go to the `Library` section, and update the `App Installer` to fix this.

<br />

- Install Tailscale on all the devices you want to connect.
- Log in to the same Tailscale account on each device.
- Once connected, you can access shared folders on a remote PC by typing the device's **Tailscale IP address** into File Explorer. For example, you can type `\\100.x.x.x` in the address bar to see shared folders on that device.
- You can also use this same IP address to connect with TightVNC, providing a secure and simple way to access your desktop from anywhere.

</Visit>

<br />

Since Tailscale creates a secure, private network between your devices, you'll need to use the **Tailscale IP address** of the remote PC to connect with TightVNC. This is a special IP address in the `100.x.x.x` range that is assigned by Tailscale and remains stable no matter where the computer is located.

<Expand title="On the PC You Want to Control (the Host)">

- **Set a password**: A password is required to connect to the host PC. When the TightVNC Server first runs, you will be prompted to set a `VNC Password` for full control and, optionally, a `View-Only Password` if you want to allow someone to just view your screen.
- **Find the PC's Tailscale IP address**: Find the Tailscale icon in your system tray (bottom right corner of the screen, next to the clock). Click on it and you will see a list of your connected devices, along with their assigned `100.x.x.x` IP address. You can copy this address to your clipboard to use it later.

</Expand>

<Expand title="On the PC You Are Using to Control (the Guest)">

- **Open the viewer**: Run the TightVNC Viewer program on the guest PC.
- **Enter the host PC's Tailscale IP address**: In the `Remote Host` field, type the Tailscale IP address you found from the host PC.
- **Connect and enter the password**: Click the `Connect` button. A window will pop up asking for the VNC Password you set earlier. Enter the password, and you should be able to see and control the host PC's desktop.
