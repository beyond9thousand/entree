## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass" /> Search Engines

Popular search engines provided by proprietary companies are known for tracking user data and using this information to then throw targeted advertisements at the user. Using a good search engine is the difference between constant intrusion of privacy, favoring confirmation biases and an uncensored, non-intrusive, informative search experience.

To enable ad-blocking through private DNS:

- Go to **Settings > Network and Internet > Advanced > Private DNS**
- Select the field for entering private DNS provider
- To use [AdGuard's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdGuard) resolver, copy and paste the following server address

```
dns.adguard.com
```

- Save your settings and continue browsing

Advertisements shown inside major social media apps are an exception to this feature since they do not fall under consistent [host names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_blocking#Hosts_file_and_DNS_manipulation) required for enforcing ad-blocking

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-lock" /> Password manager

A password manager is a an application designed to store and manage online credentials. Passwords are generally stored in an encrypted database and locked behind a master password. Most applications also offer an in-built password generator. User created passwords are prone to [brute-force attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack) and inconvenient to maintain across a large number of accounts.

:::info
Most modern browsers will also offer password generators and offer to save your login information. Google offers this on Android devices to make the experience more integrated. However, this should not be preferred over [standalone solutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-it-ok-to-use-your-browsers-built-in-password-manager/)

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-fingerprint" /> Two-factor authentication

[Two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Two-factor_authentication) or **2FA** is a secondary code in addition to your account password. The code can either be a 6-digit [OTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password) shared with you through your registered phone number. It can also be periodically generated on your mobile device using a [TOTP authenticator](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/totp). A fallback method is usually provided known as [backup codes](https://support.authy.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260803525789-What-is-a-Recovery-or-Backup-Code-) in the event of loss of access to other, more preferable 2FA options.

:::danger
Using private messaging services, including social media platforms without activating 2FA is extremely dangerous. You are practically asking to get **hacked, impersonated and doxxed online.** It is highly advised against turning-off 2FA for convenience purposes even for everyday general usage.

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-regular fa-envelope" /> Temporary email services

Use a disposable email address instead of your work or personal account when unsure about signing up on a new service. An added benefit of using throaway email addresses is that you avoid ending up in random news mail letter subscriptions & other such annoyances.
