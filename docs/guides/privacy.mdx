# Privacy

Every individual should be able to uphold their right to privacy online, including but not limited to protection of personal data and respect for confidentiality. Personal data should only be processed or transferred to third parties with your informed consent with the **clear and concise choice** to opt out.

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-scale-balanced" /> Terms of Service

**_I have read and agree to the terms & conditions_** - One of the biggest, if not **the** [biggest lie](https://advancetitan.com/opinion/2021/09/15/who-really-reads-terms-and-conditions) you'll tell yourself throughout your lifetime on the internet. Terms of service are often too long to read, but it's important to understand what's in them. Your rights online depend on them.

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass" /> Search Engines

Many popular search engines collect user data to personalize advertisements. This can limit your exposure to diverse viewpoints and potentially create confirmation bias.  Privacy-focused search engines offer an alternative, prioritizing user privacy and delivering uncensored, informative search results.

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-ban" /> Ad-blocking

Don't pretend that you love to see advertisements.

<expand title="Private DNS">

Starting with android 9, you have the option of enabling seamless ad-block system wide. This is achieved using [DNS over TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS) with the help of [private DNS](https://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-dns-announcement.html) providers.

To enable ad-blocking through private DNS:

- Go to **Settings > Network and Internet > Advanced > Private DNS**
- Select the field for entering private DNS provider
- To use [AdGuard's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdGuard) resolver, copy and paste the following server address

```
dns.adguard.com
```

- Save your settings and continue browsing

**Adguard's DNS doesn't work for me, are there other alternatives?**

Yes. There are several other DNS providers that offer ad-blocking. Look for the DNS-over-TLS sections for each provider in the link provided below. Adguard regularly updates a list of known DNS providers. `tls://` should be removed from the entries before using them on your Android device.

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-lock" /> Password manager

Password managers securely store and manage online login credentials. These applications encrypt passwords in a central vault, accessible only with a master password.  They also often generate strong, unique passwords to prevent brute-force attacks and eliminate the burden of remembering numerous credentials.

:::info
While many browsers offer built-in password managers and login saving, these features may not be ideal for optimal security. Standalone password managers often provide stronger encryption, multi-device access, and additional security features not found in browsers.

### Stateless generator

Password generator that does not store any database files online or create one locally. [Learn more here](https://blog.lesspass.com/2016-10-19/how-does-it-work)

:::success
This is an excellent choice for handling internet banking. You are only reliant on your master password in combination with a 'site name' & 'login name' which in turn outputs a highly secure password which is unique to that exact combination.

### Built-in cloud integration

Password databases are encrypted but hosted on the provider's servers

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-fingerprint" /> Two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. It requires a second code, in addition to your password, to log in. This code can be:

- A 6-digit one-time password (OTP) sent to your registered phone number.
- Generated periodically on your mobile device using a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) authenticator app.

Backup codes are usually provided as a recovery method in case you lose access to your preferred 2FA methods.

:::danger
Disabling 2FA on private messaging services and social media platforms significantly weakens your account security. This increases the risk of unauthorized access, impersonation, and exposure of private information.  For optimal protection, enabling 2FA is highly recommended.

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-regular fa-envelope" /> Temporary email services

Use a disposable email address instead of your work or personal account when unsure about signing up on a new service. An added benefit of using throaway email addresses is that you avoid ending up in random news mail letter subscriptions & other such annoyances.
