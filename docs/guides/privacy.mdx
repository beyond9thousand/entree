# Privacy

Every individual should be able to uphold their right to privacy online, including but not limited to protection of personal data and respect for confidentiality. Personal data should only be processed or transferred to third parties with your informed consent with the **clear and concise choice** to opt out.

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-scale-balanced" /> Terms of Service

**_I have read and agree to the terms & conditions_** - One of the biggest, if not **the** [biggest lie](https://advancetitan.com/opinion/2021/09/15/who-really-reads-terms-and-conditions) you'll tell yourself throughout your lifetime on the internet. Terms of service are often too long to read, but it's important to understand what's in them. Your rights online depend on them.

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass" /> Search Engines

Popular search engines provided by proprietary companies are known for [tracking user data](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-017-0524-z) and using this information to then throw targeted advertisements at the user. Using a good search engine is the difference between constant intrusion of privacy, favoring [confirmation biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias) and an uncensored, non-intrusive, informative search experience.

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-ban" /> Ad-blocking

Don't pretend that you love to see advertisements.

<expand title="Private DNS">

Starting with android 9, you have the option of enabling seamless ad-block system wide. This is achieved using [DNS over TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS) with the help of [private DNS](https://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-dns-announcement.html) providers.

To enable ad-blocking through private DNS:

- Go to **Settings > Network and Internet > Advanced > Private DNS**
- Select the field for entering private DNS provider
- To use [AdGuard's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdGuard) resolver, copy and paste the following server address

```
dns.adguard.com
```

- Save your settings and continue browsing

**Adguard's DNS doesn't work for me, are there other alternatives?**

Yes. There are several other DNS providers that offer ad-blocking. Look for the DNS-over-TLS sections for each provider in the link provided below. Adguard regularly updates a list of known DNS providers. `tls://` should be removed from the entries before using them on your Android device.

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-lock" /> Password manager

A password manager is a an application designed to store and manage online credentials. Passwords are generally stored in an [encrypted database](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/store-password-database/) and locked behind a master password. Most applications also offer an in-built password generator. User created passwords are prone to [brute-force attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack) and inconvenient to maintain across a large number of accounts.

:::info
Most modern browsers will also offer password generators and offer to save your login information. Google offers this on Android devices to make the experience more integrated. However, this should not be preferred over [standalone solutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-it-ok-to-use-your-browsers-built-in-password-manager/)
:::

### Stateless generator

Password generator that does not store any database files online or create one locally. [Learn more here](https://blog.lesspass.com/2016-10-19/how-does-it-work)

<br />

:::success
This is an excellent choice for handling internet banking. You are only reliant on your master password in combination with a 'site name' & 'login name' which in turn outputs a highly secure password which is unique to that exact combination.

### Built-in cloud integration

Password databases are encrypted but hosted on the provider's servers

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-solid fa-fingerprint" /> Two-factor authentication

[Two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Two-factor_authentication) or **2FA** is a secondary code in addition to your account password. The code can either be a 6-digit [OTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password) shared with you through your registered phone number. It can also be periodically generated on your mobile device using a [TOTP authenticator](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/totp). A fallback method is usually provided known as [backup codes](https://support.authy.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260803525789-What-is-a-Recovery-or-Backup-Code-) in the event of loss of access to other, more preferable 2FA options.

:::danger
Using private messaging services, including social media platforms without activating 2FA is extremely dangerous. You are practically asking to get **hacked, impersonated and doxxed online.** It is highly advised against turning-off 2FA for convenience purposes even for general use.

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon="fa-regular fa-envelope" /> Temporary email services

Use a disposable email address instead of your work or personal account when unsure about signing up on a new service. An added benefit of using throaway email addresses is that you avoid ending up in random news mail letter subscriptions & other such annoyances.
